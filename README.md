Fork of [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) [library](https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/html-pythoncma/) by [Nikolaus Hansen](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~nikolaus.hansen/). To my knowledge his library had not been hosted on GitHub earlier. Originally optained from [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma).
